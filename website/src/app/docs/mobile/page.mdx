# Mobile Support

Trix supports mobile-first workflows via separate modules for platform-specific tooling.

Please choose a platform to get started:

- [React Native](/docs/mobile/react-native)
- [Flutter](/docs/mobile/flutter)

This section will grow with guides, examples, and known limitations for each platform. Contributions welcome!
