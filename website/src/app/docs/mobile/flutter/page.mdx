# Flutter

Trix plans to provide a `@trix/plugin-flutter` for generating Flutter projects and integrating with backend templates.

## What you'll get

- Dart project scaffold with a recommended folder layout
- Optional backend integrations and API clients

## Getting started

1. Install Flutter SDK and set up your editor.
2. Run `trix init` and select **Flutter** under the mobile options.

## Notes

- Flutter support is experimental and contributions are welcome. If you want to help, open an issue describing your use case and preferred workflow.
