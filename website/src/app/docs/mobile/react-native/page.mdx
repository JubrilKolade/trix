Trix can scaffold a React Native app using the `@trix/plugin-react-native` module (coming soon).

## What you'll get

- TypeScript-ready React Native project
- Optional authentication & database modules
- Example navigation setup

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have the React Native toolchain installed (Node, watchman, Android SDK / Xcode).
2. Run `trix init` and select **React Native** when prompted.
3. Follow the platform-specific device setup guides for Android and iOS.

## Notes

- We recommend using the **Expo** workflow for a faster development loop when possible.
- If you prefer bare React Native, the plugin will include build scripts and native modules as appropriate.
